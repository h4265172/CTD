# CTD

This GitHub repository contains code example of Clustered Temporal Decomposition. 

* See ```CTD.py``` for the main Clustered Temporal Decomposition training function.
* ```data_genarator.py``` contains the data-generating function for simulation experiments.
* ```util.py``` contians the performance measure functions.
* ```data_loader.py``` contains a mini-batch loading function for stochastic gradient descent.

* ```simulation.ipynb``` demonstrates appropriate usage of all the above files through a simulation experiment.
