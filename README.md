# CTD

This GitHub repository contains code for Clustered Temporal Decomposition. 
## Jupyter Notebooks
* ```Simple_Demo_with_Instructions.ipynb``` demonstrates appropriate usage of the above files through a simulation experiment.
*

## Code for architecture
* See ```CTD_ARIMA.py``` and ```CTD_TCN.py``` for the two main Clustered Temporal Decomposition training classes.
* ```data_genarator.py``` contains the data-generating function for simulation experiments.
* ```util.py``` contains the performance measure functions.
* ```data_loader.py``` contains a mini-batch loading function for stochastic gradient descent.
